This is a patched version of the Quake2 Engine from http://icculus.org/. It hasn't been updated in a while, and as such has lots of compatibility issues with the latest OS's. I started with an svn checkout and began patching it with numerous different patches until it ran on my machine (Debian Squeeze, x86_64). 

It also has some changes to allow building on PPC64 machines, although this is still experimental
NOTE: For PPC64, the normal quake executable has been disabled, due to issues with alsa sound. sdlquake will be built by default instead.
NOTE: For PPC64, you must rename gameppc64.so to gameppc.so. This will be fixed in a later update (I'm not exactly sure how it determines the name of the library)
