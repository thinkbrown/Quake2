This is a patched version of the Quake2 Engine from http://icculus.org/. It hasn't been updated in a while, and as such has lots of compatibility issues with the latest OS's. I started with an svn checkout and began patching it with numerous different patches until it ran on my machine (Debian Squeeze, x86_64)
