This is a patched version of the Quake2 Engine from http://icculus.org/. It hasn't been updated in a while, and as such has lots of compatibility issues with the latest OS's. I started with an svn checkout and began patching it with numerous different patches until it ran on my machines.

It also has some changes to allow building on PPC64 machines, although this is still experimental
NOTE: For PPC64, the normal quake executable has been disabled, due to issues with alsa sound. sdlquake will be built by default instead.
